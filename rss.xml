            <description><![CDATA[<h1>Evacrity in a nutshell</h1>,<p>The main goal is to explore and promote the physical and realistic side of VR. Anyone can play VR games with controllers. We’re always after a workout. That’s one of the key points, plain and simple. VR is an exciting environment to train physical attributes or conduct physical therapy.
